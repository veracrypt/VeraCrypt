IS" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. THE AUTHORS AND
DISTRIBUTORS OF THE SOFTWARE DISCLAIM ANY LIABILITY. ANYONE WHO
USES, COPIES, MODIFIES, OR (RE)DISTRIBUTES ANY PART OF THE
SOFTWARE IS, BY SUCH ACTION(S), ACCEPTING AND AGREEING TO BE
BOUND BY ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE. IF YOU DO NOT
ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE, COPY, MODIFY, NOR (RE)DISTRIBUTE THE
SOFTWARE, NOR ANY PART(S) THEREOF.


I. Definitions

1. "This Product" means the work (including, but not limited to,
source code, graphics, texts, and accompanying files) made
available under and governed by this version of this license
("License"), as may be indicated by, but is not limited to,
copyright notice(s) attached to or included in the work.

2. "You" means (and "Your" refers to) an individual or a legal
entity (e.g., a non-profit organization, commercial
organization, government agency, etc.) exercising permissions
granted by this License.

3. "Modification" means (and "modify" refers to) any alteration
of This Product, including, but not limited to, addition to or
deletion from the substance or structure of This Product,
translation into another language, repackaging, alteration or
removal of any file included with This Product, and addition of
any new files to This Product.

4. "Your Product" means This Product modified by You, or any
work You derive from (or base on) any part of This Product. In
addition, "Your Product" means any work in which You include any
(modified or unmodified) portion of This Product. However, if
the work in which you include it is an aggregate software
distribution (such as an operating system distribution or a
cover CD-ROM of a magazine) containing multiple separate
products, then the term "Your Product" includes only those
products (in the aggregate software distribution) that use,
include, or depend on a modified or unmodified version of This
Product (and the term "Your Product" does not include the whole
aggregate software distribution). For the purposes of this
License, a product suite consisting of two or more products is
considered a single product (operating system distributions and
cover media of magazines are not considered product suites).

5. "Distribution" means (and "distribute" refers to), regardless
of means or methods, conveyance, transfer, providing, or making
available of This/Your Product or portions thereof to third
parties (including, but not limited to, making This/Your
Product, or portions thereof, available for download to third
parties, whether or not any third party has downloaded the
product, or any portion thereof, made available for download).



II. Use, Copying, and Distribution of This Product

1. Provided that You comply with all applicable terms and
conditions of this License, You may make copies of This Product
(unmodified) and distribute copies of This Product (unmodified)
that are not included in another product forming Your Product
(except as permitted under Chapter III). Note: For terms and
conditions for copying and distribution of modified versions of
This Product, see Chapter III.

2. Provided that You comply with all applicable terms and
conditions of this License, You may use This Product freely (see
also Chapter III) on any number of computers/systems for non-
commercial and/or commercial purposes.



III. Modification, Derivation, and Inclusion in Other Products

1. If all conditions specified in the following paragraphs in
this Chapter (III) are met (for exceptions, see Section III.2)
and if You comply with all other applicable terms and conditions
of this License, You may modify This Product (thus forming Your
Product), derive new works from This Product or portions thereof
(thus forming Your Product), include This Product or portions
thereof in another product (thus forming Your Product, unless
defined otherwise in Chapter I), and You may use (for non-
commercial and/or commercial purposes), copy, and/or distribute
Your Product.

    a. The name of Your Product (or of Your modified version of
    This Product) must not contain the name TrueCrypt (for
    example, the following names are not allowed: TrueCrypt,
    TrueCrypt+, TrueCrypt Professional, iTrueCrypt, etc.) nor
    any other names confusingly similar to the name TrueCrypt
    (e.g., True-Crypt, True Crypt, TruKrypt, etc.)

    All occurrences of the name TrueCrypt that could reasonably
    be considered to identify Your Product must be removed from
    Your Product and from any associated materials. Logo(s)
    included in (or attached to) Your Product (and in/to
    associated materials) must not incorporate and must not be
    confusingly similar to any of the TrueCrypt logos
    (including, but not limited to, the non-textual logo
    consisting primarily of a key in stylized form) or
    portion(s) thereof. All graphics contained in This Product
    (logos, icons, etc.) must be removed from Your Product (or
    from Your modified version of This Product) and from any
    associated materials.

    b. The following phrases must be removed from Your Product
    and from any associated materials, except the text of this
    License: "A TrueCrypt Foundation Release", "Released by
    TrueCrypt Foundation", "This is a TrueCrypt Foundation
    release."

    c. Phrase "Based on TrueCrypt, freely available at
    http://www.truecrypt.org/" must be displayed by Your Product
    (if technically feasible) and contained in its
    documentation. Alternatively, if This Product or its portion
    You included in Your Product constitutes only a minor
    portion of Your Product, phrase "Portions of this product
    are based in part on TrueCrypt, freely available at
    http://www.truecrypt.org/" may be displayed instead. In each
    of the cases mentioned above in this paragraph,
    "http://www.truecrypt.org/" must be a hyperlink (if
    technically feasible) pointing to http://www.truecrypt.org/
    and You may freely choose the location within the user
    interface (if there is any) of Your Product (e.g., an
    "About" window, etc.) and the way in which Your Product will
    display the respective phrase.

    Your Product (and any associated materials, e.g., the
    documentation, the content of the official web site of Your
    Product, etc.) must not present any Internet address
    containing the domain name truecrypt.org (or any domain name
    that forwards to the domain name truecrypt.org) in a manner
    that might suggest that it is where information about Your
    Product may be obtained or where bugs found in Your Product
    may be reported or where support for Your Product may be
    available or otherwise attempt to indicate that the domain
    name truecrypt.org is associated with Your Product.

    d. The complete source code of Your Product must be freely
    and publicly available (for exceptions, see Section III.2)
    at least until You cease to distribute Your Product. This
    condition can be met in one or both of the following ways:
    (i) You include the complete source code of Your Product
    with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute
    and You make all such copies of Your Product available to
    the general public free of charge, and/or (ii) You include
    information (valid and correct at least until You cease to
    distribute Your Product) about where the complete source
    code of Your Product can be obtained free of charge (e.g.,
    an Internet address) or for a reasonable reproduction fee
    with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute
    and, if there is a web site officially associated with Your
    Product, You include the aforementioned information about
    the source code on a freely and publicly accessible web
    page to which such web site links via an easily viewable
    hyperlink (at least until You cease to distribute Your
    Product).

    The source code of Your Product must not be deliberately
    obfuscated and it must not be in an intermediate form (e.g.,
    the output of a preprocessor). Source code means the
    preferred form in which a programmer would usually modify
    the program.

    Portions of the source code of Your Product not contained in
    This Product (e.g., portions added by You in creating Your
    Product, whether created by You or by third parties) must be
    available under license(s) that (however, see also
    Subsection III.1.e) allow(s) anyone to modify and derive new
    works from the portions of the source code that are not
    contained in This Product and to use, copy, and redistribute
    such modifications and/or derivative works. The license(s)
    must be perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, no-charge,
    and worldwide, and must not invalidate, weaken, restrict,
    interpret, amend, modify, interfere with or otherwise affect
    any part, term, provision, or clause of this License. The
    text(s) of the license(s) must be included with every copy
    of Your Product that You make and distribute.

    e. You must not change the license terms of This Product in
    any way (adding any new terms is considered changing the
    license terms even if the original terms are retained),
    which means, e.g., that no part of This Product may be put
    under another license. You must keep intact all the legal
    notices contained in the source code files. You must include
    the following items with every copy of Your Product that You
    make and distribute: a clear and conspicuous notice stating
    that Your Product or portion(s) thereof is/are governed by
    this version of the TrueCrypt License, a verbatim copy of
    this version of the TrueCrypt License (as contained herein),
    a clear and conspicuous notice containing information about
    where the included copy of the License can be found, and an
    appropriate copyright notice.


2. You are not obligated to comply with Subsection III.1.d if
Your Product is not distributed (i.e., Your Product is available
only to You).
