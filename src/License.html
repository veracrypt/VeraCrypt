Software distributed under this license is distributed on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. THE AUTHORS AND DISTRIBUTORS OF THE SOFTWARE DISCLAIM ANY LIABILITY. ANYONE WHO USES, COPIES, MODIFIES, OR (RE)DISTRIBUTES ANY PART OF THE SOFTWARE IS, BY SUCH ACTION(S), ACCEPTING AND AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE.

<br>
<br><b>I. Definitions</b><br>
<br><b>1</b>. &quot;This Product&quot; means the work (including, but not limited to, source code, graphics, texts, and accompanying files) made available under and governed by this version of this license (&quot;License&quot;), as may be indicated by, but is not limited to, copyright notice(s) attached to or included in the work.<br>
<br><b>2</b>. &quot;You&quot; means (and &quot;Your&quot; refers to) an individual or a legal entity (e.g., a non-profit organization, commercial organization, government agency, etc.) exercising permissions granted by this License.<br>
<br><b>3</b>. &quot;Modification&quot; means (and &quot;modify&quot; refers to) any alteration of This Product, including, but not limited to, addition to or deletion from the substance or structure of This Product, translation into another language, repackaging, alteration or removal of any file included with This Product, and addition of any new files to This Product.<br>
<br>
<b>4</b>. &quot;Your Product&quot; means This Product modified by You, or any work You derive from (or base on) any part of This Product. In addition, &quot;Your Product&quot; means any work in which You include any (modified or unmodified) portion of This Product. However, if the work in which you include it is an aggregate software distribution (such as an operating system distribution or a cover CD-ROM of a magazine) containing multiple separate products, then the term &quot;Your Product&quot; includes only those products (in the aggregate software distribution) that use, include, or depend on a modified or unmodified version of This Product (and the term &quot;Your Product&quot; does not include the whole aggregate software distribution). For the purposes of this License, a product suite consisting of two or more products is considered a single product (operating system distributions and cover media of magazines are not considered product suites).<br>
<br><b>5</b>. &quot;Distribution&quot; means (and &quot;distribute&quot; refers to), regardless of means or methods, conveyance, transfer, providing, or making available of This/Your Product or portions thereof to third parties (including, but not limited to, making This/Your Product, or portions thereof, available for download to third parties, whether or not any third party has downloaded the product, or any portion thereof, made available for download).<br>
<br><br>
<br><b>II. Use, Copying, and Distribution of This Product</b><br>
<br>
<b>1</b>. Provided that You comply with all applicable terms and conditions of this License, You may make copies of This Product (unmodified) and distribute copies of This Product (unmodified) that are not included in another product forming Your Product (except as permitted under Chapter III). Note: For terms and conditions for copying and distribution of modified versions of This Product, see Chapter III.<br>
<br><b>2</b>. Provided that You comply with all applicable terms and conditions of this License, You may use This Product freely (see also Chapter III) on any number of computers/systems for non-commercial and/or commercial purposes.<br>
<br><br>
<br><b>III. Modification, Derivation, and Inclusion in Other Products</b><br>
<br>
<b>1</b>. If all conditions specified in the following paragraphs in this Chapter (III) are met (for exceptions, see Section III.2) and if You comply with all other applicable terms and conditions of this License, You may modify This Product (thus forming Your Product), derive new works from This Product or portions thereof (thus forming Your Product), include This Product or portions thereof in another product (thus forming Your Product, unless defined otherwise in Chapter I), and You may use (for non-commercial and/or commercial purposes), copy, and/or distribute Your Product.<br>
<br>
<ol type="a">
  <li>The name of Your Product (or of Your modified version of This Product) must not contain the name TrueCrypt (for example, the following names are not allowed: TrueCrypt, TrueCrypt+, TrueCrypt Professional, iTrueCrypt, etc.) nor any other names confusingly similar to the name TrueCrypt (e.g., True-Crypt, True Crypt, TruKrypt, etc.)<br>
    <br>
    All occurrences of the name TrueCrypt that could reasonably be considered to identify Your Product must be removed from Your Product and from any associated materials. Logo(s) included in (or attached to) Your Product (and in/to associated materials) must not incorporate and must not be confusingly similar to any of the TrueCrypt logos (including, but not limited to, the non-textual logo consisting primarily of a key in stylized form) or portion(s) thereof. All graphics contained in This Product (logos, icons, etc.) must be removed from Your Product (or from Your modified version of This Product) and from any associated materials.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The following phrases must be removed from Your Product and from any associated materials, except the text of this License: &quot;A TrueCrypt Foundation Release&quot;, &quot;Released by TrueCrypt Foundation&quot;, &quot;This is a TrueCrypt Foundation release.&quot;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Phrase &quot;<i>Based on TrueCrypt, freely available at http://www.truecrypt.org/</i>&quot; must be displayed by Your Product (if technically feasible) and contained in its documentation. Alternatively, if This Product or its portion You included in Your Product constitutes only a minor portion of Your Product, phrase &quot;<i>Portions of this product are based in part on TrueCrypt, freely available at http://www.truecrypt.org/</i>&quot; may be displayed instead. In each of the cases mentioned above in this paragraph, &quot;<i>http://www.truecrypt.org/</i>&quot; must be a hyperlink (if technically feasible) pointing to http://www.truecrypt.org/ and You may freely choose the location within the user interface (if there is any) of Your Product (e.g., an &quot;About&quot; window, etc.) and the way in which Your Product will display the respective phrase.<br>
    <br>
  Your Product (and any associated materials, e.g., the documentation, the content of the official web site of Your Product, etc.) must not present any Internet address containing the domain name truecrypt.org (or any domain name that forwards to the domain name truecrypt.org) in a manner that might suggest that it is where information about Your Product may be obtained or where bugs found in Your Product may be reported or where support for Your Product may be available or otherwise attempt to indicate that the domain name truecrypt.org is associated with Your Product.<br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li>The complete source code of Your Product must be freely and publicly available (for exceptions, see Section III.2) at least until You cease to distribute Your Product. This condition can be met in one or both of the following ways: (i) You include the complete source code of Your Product with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute and You make all such copies of Your Product available to the general public free of charge, and/or (ii) You include information (valid and correct at least until You cease to distribute Your Product) about where the complete source code of Your Product can be obtained free of charge (e.g., an Internet address) or for a reasonable reproduction fee with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute and, if there is a web site officially associated with Your Product, You include the aforementioned information about the source code on a freely and publicly accessible web page to which such web site links via an easily viewable hyperlink (at least until You cease to distribute Your Product).<br>
    <br>
The source code of Your Product must not be deliberately obfuscated and it must not be in an intermediate form (e.g., the output of a preprocessor). Source code means the preferred form in which a programmer would usually modify the program.<br>
    <br>
  Portions of the source code of Your Product not contained in This Product (e.g., portions added by You in creating Your Product, whether created by You or by third parties) must be available under license(s) that (however, see also Subsection III.1.e) allow(s) anyone to modify and derive new works from the portions of the source code that are not contained in This Product and to use, copy, and redistribute such modifications and/or derivative works. The license(s) must be perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, no-charge, and worldwide, and must not invalidate, weaken, restrict, interpret, amend, modify, interfere with or otherwise affect any part, term, provision, or clause of this License. The text(s) of the license(s) must be included with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute.<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>You must not change the license terms of This Product in any way (adding any new terms is considered changing the license terms even if the original terms are retained), which means, e.g., that no part of This Product may be put under another license. You must keep intact all the legal notices contained in the source code files. You must include the following items with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute: a clear and conspicuous notice stating that Your Product or portion(s) thereof is/are governed by this version of the TrueCrypt License, a verbatim copy of this version of the TrueCrypt License (as contained herein), a clear and conspicuous notice containing information about where the included copy of the License can be found, and an appropriate copyright notice.<br>
</li>
</ol>
<b>2</b>. You are not obligated to comply with Subsection III.1.d if Your Product is not distributed (i.e., Your Product is available only to You).<br>
