To do so, follow these steps:\n1) Right-click the 'Computer' (or 'My Computer') icon in the 'Start Menu' and select 'Manage'. The 'Computer Management' window should appear.\n2) In the 'Computer Management' window, select 'Storage' > 'Disk Management'.\n3) Right-click the partition you want to encrypt and select either 'Delete Partition', or 'Delete Volume', or 'Delete Logical Drive'.\n4) Click 'Yes'. If Windows asks you to restart the computer, do so. Then repeat the steps 1 and 2 and continue from the step 5.\n5) Right-click the unallocated/free space area and select either 'New Partition', or 'New Simple Volume', or 'New Logical Drive'.\n6) The 'New Partition Wizard' or 'New Simple Volume Wizard' window should appear now; follow its instructions. On the wizard page entitled 'Format Partition', select either 'Do not format this partition' or 'Do not format this volume'. In the same wizard, click 'Next' and then 'Finish'.\n7) Note that the device path you have selected in VeraCrypt may be wrong now. Therefore, exit the VeraCrypt Volume Creation Wizard (if it is still running) and then start it again.\n8) Try encrypting the device/partition again.\n\nIf VeraCrypt repeatedly fails to encrypt the device/partition, you may want to consider creating a file container instead.</entry>

A device that contains partitions can be entirely encrypted in place (using a single master key) only if it is the drive where Windows is installed and from which it boots.\n\nIf you want to encrypt the selected non-system device using a single master key, you will need to remove all partitions on the device first to enable VeraCrypt to format it safely (formatting a device that contains partitions might cause system instability and/or data corruption). Alternatively, you can encrypt each partition on the drive individually (each partition will be encrypted using a different master key).\n\nNote: If you want to remove all partitions from a GPT disk, you may need to convert it to a MBR disk (using e.g. the Computer Management tool) in order to remove hidden partitions.</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="WHOLE_NONSYS_DEVICE_ENC_CONFIRM">Warning: If you encrypt the entire device (as opposed to encrypting only a partition on it), operating systems will consider the device as new, empty, and unformatted (as it will contain no partition table) and may spontaneously initialize the device (or ask you if you want to do so), which may damage the volume. Furthermore, it will not be possible to consistently mount the volume as favorite (e.g. when the drive number changes) or to assign a favorite-volume label to it.\n\nTo avoid that you may want to consider creating a partition on the device and encrypting the partition instead.\n\nAre you sure want to encrypt the entire device?</entry>

The volume will be mounted to a different drive letter, which you select from the list in the main VeraCrypt window.\n\nThe original drive letter %c: should be used only in case you need to remove encryption from the partition/device (e.g., if you no longer need encryption). In such a case, right-click the drive letter %c: in the 'Computer' (or 'My Computer') list and select 'Format'. Otherwise, the drive letter %c: should never be used (unless you remove it, as described e.g. in the VeraCrypt FAQ, and assign it to another partition/device).</entry>

That way, you will create a VeraCrypt-encrypted backup of the data.\n\n3) Create a VeraCrypt volume on the partition that you originally wanted to encrypt and make sure that (in the VeraCrypt wizard) you choose the option "Create encrypted volume and format it" (instead of the option "Encrypt partition in place").

After the volume is created, mount it.\n\n4) Copy all files from the mounted backup VeraCrypt volume (created and mounted in step 1) to the mounted VeraCrypt volume that has been created (and mounted) in step 3.\n\nAfter you complete these steps, the data will be encrypted and, in addition, there will be an encrypted backup of the data.</entry>

To create a hidden volume securely, follow these steps:\n\n1) Boot the decoy system.\n\n2) Create a normal VeraCrypt volume and, to this volume, copy some sensitive-looking files that you actually do NOT want to hide (the volume will become the outer volume).\n\n3) Boot the hidden system and start the VeraCrypt Volume Creation Wizard. If the volume is file-hosted, move it to the system partition or to another hidden volume (otherwise, the newly created hidden volume would be mounted as read-only and could not be formatted). Follow the instructions in the wizard so as to select the 'direct' hidden volume creation mode.\n\n4) In the wizard, select the volume you created in step 2 and then follow the instructions to create a hidden volume within it.</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="HIDDEN_OS_WRITE_PROTECTION_BRIEF_INFO">For security reasons, when a hidden operating system is running, local unencrypted filesystems and non-hidden VeraCrypt volumes are mounted as read-only (no data can be written to such filesystems or VeraCrypt volumes).\n\nData is allowed to be written to any filesystem that resides within a hidden VeraCrypt volume (provided that the hidden volume is not located in a container stored on an unencrypted filesystem or on any other read-only filesystem).</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="HIDDEN_OS_WRITE_PROTECTION_EXPLANATION">There are three main reasons why such countermeasures have been implemented:\n\n- It enables the creation of a secure platform for mounting of hidden VeraCrypt volumes. Note that we officially recommend that hidden volumes are mounted only when a hidden operating system is running. (For more information, see the subsection 'Security Requirements and Precautions Pertaining to Hidden Volumes' in the documentation.)\n\n- In some cases, it is possible to determine that, at a certain time, a particular filesystem was not mounted under (or that a particular file on the filesystem was not saved or accessed from within) a particular instance of an operating system (e.g. by analyzing and comparing filesystem journals, file timestamps, application logs, error logs, etc). This might indicate that a hidden operating system is installed on the computer. The countermeasures prevent these issues.\n\n- It prevents data corruption and allows safe hibernation. When Windows resumes from hibernation, it assumes that all mounted filesystems are in the same state as when the system entered hibernation. VeraCrypt ensures this by write-protecting any filesystem accessible both from within the decoy and hidden systems. Without such protection, the filesystem could become corrupted when mounted by one system while the other system is hibernated.</entry>

    <entry lang="en" key="TRAVELER_LIMITATIONS_NOTE">Note about portable mode:\n\nPlease note that the operating system requires drivers to be registered with it before they can be started. Hence, the VeraCrypt driver is not (and cannot be) fully portable (whereas the VeraCrypt applications are fully portable, i.e. they do not have to be installed or registered with the operating system). Also note that VeraCrypt needs a driver to provide transparent on-the-fly encryption/decryption.</entry>

VeraCrypt needs a device driver to provide transparent on-the-fly encryption/decryption, and users without administrator privileges cannot start device drivers in Windows. Therefore, the system will ask you for permission to run VeraCrypt with administrator privileges (UAC prompt).\n\nNote that if you install VeraCrypt on the system (as opposed to running VeraCrypt in portable mode), the system will NOT ask you for permission to run VeraCrypt (UAC prompt) every time you attempt to run it.\n\nAre you sure you want to extract the files?</entry>

If you do not have multiple operating systems installed on your computer, you can boot a WinPE or BartPE CD/DVD or you can connect your system drive as a secondary or external drive to another computer and then boot the operating system installed on the computer. After you boot a system, run VeraCrypt, click 'Select Device', select the affected system partition, click 'OK', select 'System' > 'Mount Without Pre-Boot Authentication', enter your pre-boot authentication password and click 'OK'.

Note: The reason is that the decoy system and the hidden system will share a single boot loader, which supports only a single algorithm, selected by the user (for each algorithm, there is a special version of the VeraCrypt Boot Loader).\n\n</entry>
