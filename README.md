# I. Windows

## Requirements for Building VeraCrypt for Windows:

A detailed guide on how to build VeraCrypt on Windows can be found in
the [documentation](./doc/html/CompilingGuidelineWin.html) in the repository and
it is also available [online](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/CompilingGuidelineWin.html).

IMPORTANT:

The 64-bit editions of Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, and in
some cases (e.g. playback of HD DVD content) also the 32-bit editions do not
allow the VeraCrypt driver to run without an appropriate digital signature.
Therefore, all .sys files in official VeraCrypt binary packages are digitally
signed with the digital certificate of the IDRIX, which was issued by
GlobalSign certification authority. At the end of each official .exe and
.sys file, there are embedded digital signatures and all related certificates
(i.e. all certificates in the relevant certification chain, such as the
certification authority certificates, CA-MS cross-certificate, and the
IDRIX certificate).

Keep this in mind if you compile VeraCrypt and compare your binaries with the
official binaries. If your binaries are unsigned, the sizes of the official
binaries will usually be approximately 10 KiB greater than the sizes of your
binaries (there may be further differences if you use a different version of
the compiler, or if you install a different or no service pack for Visual
Studio, or different hotfixes for it, or if you use different versions of
the required SDKs).

## Instructions for Signing and Packaging VeraCrypt for Windows:

First, create an environment variable 'WSDK81' pointing to the Windows SDK
for Windows 8.1 installation directory.

The folder "Signing" contains a batch file (sign.bat) that will sign all
VeraCrypt components using a code signing certificate present on the
certificate store and build the final installation setup and MSI package.
The batch file assumes that the code signing certificate is issued by
GlobalSign. This is the case for IDRIX's certificate. If yours is issued by
another CA, then you should put its intermediate certificates in the "Signing"
folder and modify sign.bat accordingly.

To generate MSI packages, WiX Toolset v3.11 must be installed.

## VeraCrypt EFI Boot Loader:

VeraCrypt source code contains pre-built EFI binaries under src\Boot\EFI.
The source code of VeraCrypt EFI Boot Loader is licensed under LGPL and
it is available at https://github.com/veracrypt/VeraCrypt-DCS.
For build instructions, please refer to the file src\Boot\EFI\Readme.txt.

# II. Linux and Mac OS X

A detailed guide on how to build VeraCrypt on Linux can be found in
the [documentation](./doc/html/CompilingGuidelineLinux.html) in the repository and
it is also available [online](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/CompilingGuidelineLinux.html).

## Requirements for Building VeraCrypt for Linux and Mac OS X:

- GNU Make
- GNU C++ Compiler 4.0 or compatible
- Apple Xcode or Xcode command line tools (Mac OS X only)
- YASM 1.3.0 or newer (Linux only, x86/x64 architecture only)
- pkg-config
- wxWidgets 3.0 shared library and header files installed or
  wxWidgets 3.0 library source code (available at https://www.wxwidgets.org)
- FUSE library and header files (available at https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse
  and https://osxfuse.github.io/)
- PCSC-lite library and header files (available at https://github.com/LudovicRousseau/PCSC)

## Instructions for Building VeraCrypt for Linux and Mac OS X:

1. Change the current directory to the root of the VeraCrypt source code.

2. If you have no wxWidgets shared library installed, run the following
   command to configure the wxWidgets static library for VeraCrypt and to
   build it:

   `$ make WXSTATIC=1 WX_ROOT=/usr/src/wxWidgets wxbuild`

   The variable `WX_ROOT` must point to the location of the source code of the
   wxWidgets library. Output files will be placed in the './wxrelease/'
   directory.

3. To build VeraCrypt, run the following command:

   `$ make`

   or if you have no wxWidgets shared library installed:

   `$ make WXSTATIC=1`

4. If successful, the VeraCrypt executable should be located in the directory
   'Main'.

By default, a universal executable supporting both graphical and text user
interface (through the switch --text) is built.
On Linux, a console-only executable, which requires no GUI library, can be
built using the 'NOGUI' parameter:

`$ make NOGUI=1 WXSTATIC=1 WX_ROOT=/usr/src/wxWidgets wxbuild`

`$ make NOGUI=1 WXSTATIC=1`

On MacOSX, building a console-only executable is not supported.

## Mac OS X specifics:

Under MacOSX, the latest installed SDK is used by default. To use a different version
of the SDK when building using make, you can export the environment variable VC_OSX_SDK:

`$ export VC_OSX_SDK=13.0`

For development dependencies management, you can use [homebrew](https://brew.sh).

`$ brew install pkg-config yasm wxwidgets`

You also need system dependencies

`$ brew install --cask macfuse packages`

After installing dependencies via brew, you can build a local development build

`$ ./src/Build/build_veracrypt_macosx.sh -b`

If you want to build the package, you must pass `-p` to the build script above. The built
executable will be in `.src/Main`

If you prefer to build from sources, or without homebrew, pkg-config and packages must be installed.

Get pkg-config from https://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/releases/pkg-config-0.29.2.tar.gz and
compile using the following commands:

`$ CFLAGS="-Wno-int-conversion" CXXFLAGS="-Wno-int-conversion" ./configure --with-internal-glib`

`$ make`

`$ sudo make install`

After making sure pkg-config is available, download and install OSXFuse from
https://osxfuse.github.io/

The [build_veracrypt_macosx.sh](./src/Build/build_veracrypt_macosx.sh) script performs the
full build of VeraCrypt including the creation of the installer pkg. It expects
to find the wxWidgets 3.2.5 sources at the same level as where you put
VeraCrypt sources (i.e. if "src" path is "/Users/joe/Projects/VeraCrypt/src"
then wxWidgets should be at "/Users/joe/Projects/wxWidgets-3.2.5")

The make build process uses Code Signing certificates whose ID is specified in
src/Main/Main.make (look for lines containing "Developer ID Application" and
"Developer ID Installer"). You'll have to modify these lines to put the ID of
your Code Signing certificates or comment them out if you don't have one.

Because of incompatibility issues with OSXFUSE, the SDK 10.9 generates a
VeraCrypt binary that has issues communicating with the OSXFUSE kernel extension.
Thus, we recommend using a different OSX SDK version for building VeraCrypt.

The Packages installer that is used for the VeraCrypt official build has been notarized by IDRIX and it is available at
https://github.com/idrassi/packages/releases

# III. FreeBSD

FreeBSD is supported starting from version 11.
The build requirements and instructions are the same as Linux except that gmake
should be used instead of make.

# IV. Third-Party Developers (Contributors)
