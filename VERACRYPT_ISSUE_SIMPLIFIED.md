# [RFC] Ocrypt Distributed Key Recovery - Ready for Integration

## Overview

We've successfully implemented **Ocrypt** distributed key recovery as a new PRF option in VeraCrypt. Ocrypt provides enterprise-grade key recovery through distributed cryptography, allowing organizations to recover encrypted volumes through a threshold of authorized parties.

## Current Status âœ…

- **Complete integration**: Ocrypt works as PRF #7 alongside existing algorithms
- **Volume creation/mounting**: Full functionality tested and working
- **Security features**: Secure random generation, atomic metadata updates, rollback safety
- **OpenSSL compatibility**: Uses existing OpenSSL dependencies already in VeraCrypt

## Technical Implementation

**No new dependencies required** - Ocrypt uses the existing OpenSSL `libcrypto` that's already linked in VeraCrypt for OpenADP support.

**Key features:**
- Integrates seamlessly with existing VeraCrypt PRF system
- Maintains all existing security properties (plausible deniability, hidden volumes)
- Follows VeraCrypt coding standards and architecture
- Comprehensive error handling and rollback safety

## Benefits

**For Users:**
- Enterprise key recovery without compromising security
- Eliminates risk of permanently lost encrypted data
- Optional feature - doesn't affect existing functionality

**For Organizations:**
- Regulatory compliance for data recovery requirements
- Distributed trust model (no single point of failure)
- Seamless integration with existing VeraCrypt deployments

## Implementation Details

**Code Quality:**
- Follows VeraCrypt patterns and conventions
- Comprehensive testing on multiple platforms
- Complete documentation and code comments
- Security review completed

**Integration Points:**
- Added to `src/Common/Pkcs5.c` alongside existing PRF algorithms
- Uses existing OpenSSL crypto functions (already linked)
- Metadata storage uses VeraCrypt's existing mechanisms
- Error handling follows VeraCrypt patterns

## Questions for Maintainers

1. **Are you interested** in reviewing a complete Ocrypt implementation?
2. **Any specific requirements** for enterprise-focused features?
3. **Preferred PR structure** for this type of addition?
4. **Testing requirements** beyond our current comprehensive test suite?

## Next Steps

We're ready to submit a complete pull request with:
- Full Ocrypt implementation
- Comprehensive test suite
- Documentation updates
- Build system integration

The implementation is production-ready and we're committed to maintaining it long-term as part of the VeraCrypt project.
