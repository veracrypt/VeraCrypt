<title>VeraCrypt - Free Open source disk encryption with strong security for the Paranoid</title>
<meta name="description" content="VeraCrypt is free open-source disk encryption software for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. In case an attacker forces you to reveal the password, VeraCrypt provides plausible deniability. In contrast to file encryption, data encryption performed by VeraCrypt is real-time (on-the-fly), automatic, transparent, needs very little memory, and does not involve temporary unencrypted files."/>

<h1>Command Line Usage</h1>
<p>Note that this section applies to the Windows version of VeraCrypt. For information on command line usage applying to the
<strong>Linux and Mac OS X versions</strong>, please run: veracrypt &ndash;h</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><em>/help</em> or <em>/?</em></td>
<td>Display command line help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>/truecrypt or /tc</em></td>
<td>Activate TrueCrypt compatibility mode which enables mounting volumes created with TrueCrypt 6.x and 7.x series.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>/hash</em></td>
<td>It must be followed by a parameter indicating the PRF hash algorithm to use when mounting the volume. Possible values for /hash parameter are: sha256, sha-256, sha512, sha-512, whirlpool, blake2s and blake2s-256. When /hash is omitted, VeraCrypt will try
 all possible PRF algorithms thus lengthening the mount operation time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td id="volume"><em>/volume</em> or <em>/v</em></td>
<td>
<p>It must be followed by a parameter indicating the file and path name of a VeraCrypt volume to mount (do not use when unmounting) or the Volume ID of the disk/partition to mount.<br>
The syntax of the volume ID is <strong>ID:XXXXXX...XX</strong> where the XX part is a 64 hexadecimal characters string that represent the 32-Bytes ID of the desired volume to mount.<br>
<br>
To mount a partition/device-hosted volume, use, for example, /v \Device\Harddisk1\Partition3 (to determine the path to a partition/device, run VeraCrypt and click
<em>Select Device</em>). You can also mount a partition or dynamic volume using its volume name (for example, /v \\?\Volume{5cceb196-48bf-46ab-ad00-70965512253a}\). To determine the volume name use e.g. mountvol.exe. Also note that device paths are case-sensitive.<br>
<br>
You can also specify the Volume ID of the partition/device-hosted volume to mount, for example: /v ID:53B9A8D59CC84264004DA8728FC8F3E2EE6C130145ABD3835695C29FD601EDCA. The Volume ID value can be retrieved using the volume properties dialog.</p>

<p>It must be followed by a parameter which can have one of the values indicated below.</p>
<p><strong>ro</strong> or<strong> readonly</strong>: Mount volume as read-only.</p>
<p><strong>rm</strong> or <strong>removable</strong>: Mount volume as removable medium (see section
<a href="Removable%20Medium%20Volume.html">
<em>Volume Mounted as Removable Medium</em></a>).</p>
<p><strong>ts</strong> or <strong>timestamp</strong>: Do not preserve container modification timestamp.</p>
<p><strong>sm</strong> or <strong>system</strong>: Without pre-boot authentication, mount a partition that is within the key scope of system encryption (for example, a partition located on the encrypted system drive of another operating system that is not running).
 Useful e.g. for backup or repair operations. Note: If you supply a password as a parameter of /p, make sure that the password has been typed using the standard US keyboard layout (in contrast, the GUI ensures this automatically). This is required due to the
 fact that the password needs to be typed in the pre-boot environment (before Windows starts) where non-US Windows keyboard layouts are not available.</p>
<p><strong>bk</strong> or <strong>headerbak</strong>: Mount volume using embedded backup header. Note: All volumes created by VeraCrypt contain an embedded backup header (located at the end of the volume).</p>
<p><strong>recovery</strong>: Do not verify any checksums stored in the volume header. This option should be used only when the volume header is damaged and the volume cannot be mounted even with the mount option headerbak. Example: /m ro</p>
<p><strong>label=LabelValue</strong>: Use the given string value <strong>LabelValue</strong> as a label of the mounted volume in Windows Explorer. The maximum length for
<strong>LabelValue&nbsp;</strong> is 32 characters for NTFS volumes and 11 characters for FAT volumes. For example,
<em>/m label=MyDrive</em> will set the label of the drive in Explorer to <em>MyDrive</em>.</p>
<p><strong>noattach</strong>: Only create virtual device without actually attaching the mounted volume to the selected drive letter.</p>
<p>Please note that this switch may be present several times in the command line in order to specify multiple mount options (e.g.: /m rm /m ts)</p>
