<title>VeraCrypt - Бесплатное надёжное шифрование дисков с открытым исходным кодом</title>
<meta name="description" content="VeraCrypt это бесплатное программное обеспечение для шифрования дисков с открытым исходным кодом для Windows, Mac OS X (macOS) и Linux. В случае, если злоумышленник вынуждает вас раскрыть пароль, VeraCrypt обеспечивает правдоподобное отрицание наличия шифрования. В отличие от пофайлового шифрования, VeraCrypt шифрует данные в реальном времени (на лету), автоматически, прозрачно, требует очень мало памяти и не использует временные незашифрованные файлы."/>
