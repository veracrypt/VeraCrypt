<title>VeraCrypt - Free Open source disk encryption with strong security for the Paranoid</title>
<meta name="description" content="VeraCrypt is free open-source disk encryption software for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. In case an attacker forces you to reveal the password, VeraCrypt provides plausible deniability. In contrast to file encryption, data encryption performed by VeraCrypt is real-time (on-the-fly), automatic, transparent, needs very little memory, and does not involve temporary unencrypted files."/>

<h1>Converting TrueCrypt volumes and partitions</h1>
<p><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:</strong> <span style="color: red;">After conversion, ensure that the "TrueCrypt Mode" checkbox is not selected during the mount of the converted volume. Since it is no longer a TrueCrypt volume, mounting it with this option will lead to a mount failure.</span></p>
<p><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice:</strong> As of version 1.26, VeraCrypt has removed support for "TrueCrypt Mode." Consequently, the conversion of TrueCrypt volumes and partitions using this method is no longer possible. Please refer to <a href="Conversion_Guide_VeraCrypt_1.26_and_Later.html">this documentation page</a> for guidance on how to proceed with TrueCrypt volumes in VeraCrypt versions 1.26 and later.</p>
<p>From version 1.0f up to and including version 1.25.9, TrueCrypt volumes and <strong>non-system</strong> partitions created with TrueCrypt versions 6.x and 7.x, starting with version 6.0 released on July 4th 2008, can be converted to VeraCrypt format using any of the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change Volume Password </li><li>Set Header Key Derivation Algorithm </li><li>Add/Remove key files </li><li>Remove all key files </li></ul>
<p>If the TrueCrypt volume contains a hidden volume, it should also be converted using the same approach, by specifying the hidden volume password and/or keyfiles.</p>
<p>üö® After conversion of a file container, the file extension will remain as .tc. Manually change it to .hc if you want VeraCrypt 1.26 or newer to automatically recognize it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;TrueCrypt Mode&rdquo; must be checked in the dialog as shown below:</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Converting system partitions encrypted with TrueCrypt is not supported.</p>
