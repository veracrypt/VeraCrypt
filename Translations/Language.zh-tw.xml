    <entry lang="en" key="DEVICE_PARTITIONS_ERR_W_INPLACE_ENC_NOTE">The selected non-system device contains partitions.\n\nEncrypted device-hosted VeraCrypt volumes can be created within devices that do not contain any partitions (including hard disks and solid-state drives). A device that contains partitions can be entirely encrypted in place (using a single master key) only if it is the drive where Windows is installed and from which it boots.\n\nIf you want to encrypt the selected non-system device using a single master key, you will need to remove all partitions on the device first to enable VeraCrypt to format it safely (formatting a device that contains partitions might cause system instability and/or data corruption). Alternatively, you can encrypt each partition on the drive individually (each partition will be encrypted using a different master key).\n\nNote: If you want to remove all partitions from a GPT disk, you may need to convert it to a MBR disk (using e.g. the Computer Management tool) in order to remove hidden partitions.</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="WHOLE_NONSYS_DEVICE_ENC_CONFIRM">Warning: If you encrypt the entire device (as opposed to encrypting only a partition on it), operating systems will consider the device as new, empty, and unformatted (as it will contain no partition table) and may spontaneously initialize the device (or ask you if you want to do so), which may damage the volume. Furthermore, it will not be possible to consistently mount the volume as favorite (e.g. when the drive number changes) or to assign a favorite-volume label to it.\n\nTo avoid that you may want to consider creating a partition on the device and encrypting the partition instead.\n\nAre you sure want to encrypt the entire device?</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="AFTER_FORMAT_DRIVE_LETTER_WARN">IMPORTANT: Please keep in mind that this volume can NOT be mounted/accessed using the drive letter %c:, which is currently assigned to it!\n\nTo mount this volume, click 'Auto-Mount Devices' in the main VeraCrypt window (alternatively, in the main VeraCrypt window, click 'Select Device', then select this partition/device, and click 'Mount'). The volume will be mounted to a different drive letter, which you select from the list in the main VeraCrypt window.\n\nThe original drive letter %c: should be used only in case you need to remove encryption from the partition/device (e.g., if you no longer need encryption).

    <entry lang="en" key="CANNOT_SATISFY_OVER_4G_FILE_SIZE_REQ">You have indicated intent to store files larger than 4 GB on the volume. This requires the volume to be formatted as NTFS/exFAT/ReFS, which, however, will not be possible.</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="CANNOT_CREATE_NON_HIDDEN_NTFS_VOLUMES_UNDER_HIDDEN_OS">Please note that when a hidden operating system is running, non-hidden VeraCrypt volumes cannot be formatted as NTFS/exFAT/ReFS. The reason is that the volume would need to be temporarily mounted without write protection in order to allow the operating system to format it as NTFS (whereas formatting as FAT is performed by VeraCrypt, not by the operating system, and without mounting the volume). For further technical details, see below. You can create a non-hidden NTFS/exFAT/ReFS volume from within the decoy operating system.</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="HIDDEN_VOL_CREATION_UNDER_HIDDEN_OS_HOWTO">For security reasons, when a hidden operating system is running, hidden volumes can be created only in the 'direct' mode (because outer volumes must always be mounted as read-only). To create a hidden volume securely, follow these steps:\n\n1) Boot the decoy system.\n\n2) Create a normal VeraCrypt volume and, to this volume, copy some sensitive-looking files that you actually do NOT want to hide (the volume will become the outer volume).\n\n3) Boot the hidden system and start the VeraCrypt Volume Creation Wizard. If the volume is file-hosted, move it to the system partition or to another hidden volume (otherwise, the newly created hidden volume would be mounted as read-only and could not be formatted). Follow the instructions in the wizard so as to select the 'direct' hidden volume creation mode.\n\n4) In the wizard, select the volume you created in step 2 and then follow the instructions to create a hidden volume within it.</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="HIDDEN_OS_WRITE_PROTECTION_BRIEF_INFO">For security reasons, when a hidden operating system is running, local unencrypted filesystems and non-hidden VeraCrypt volumes are mounted as read-only (no data can be written to such filesystems or VeraCrypt volumes).\n\nData is allowed to be written to any filesystem that resides within a hidden VeraCrypt volume (provided that the hidden volume is not located in a container stored on an unencrypted filesystem or on any other read-only filesystem).</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="HIDDEN_OS_WRITE_PROTECTION_EXPLANATION">There are three main reasons why such countermeasures have been implemented:\n\n- It enables the creation of a secure platform for mounting of hidden VeraCrypt volumes. Note that we officially recommend that hidden volumes are mounted only when a hidden operating system is running. (For more information, see the subsection 'Security Requirements and Precautions Pertaining to Hidden Volumes' in the documentation.)\n\n- In some cases, it is possible to determine that, at a certain time, a particular filesystem was not mounted under (or that a particular file on the filesystem was not saved or accessed from within) a particular instance of an operating system (e.g. by analyzing and comparing filesystem journals, file timestamps, application logs, error logs, etc). This might indicate that a hidden operating system is installed on the computer. The countermeasures prevent these issues.\n\n- It prevents data corruption and allows safe hibernation. When Windows resumes from hibernation, it assumes that all mounted filesystems are in the same state as when the system entered hibernation. VeraCrypt ensures this by write-protecting any filesystem accessible both from within the decoy and hidden systems. Without such protection, the filesystem could become corrupted when mounted by one system while the other system is hibernated.</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="DECOY_TO_HIDDEN_OS_DATA_TRANSFER_HOWTO">Note: If you need to securely transfer files from the decoy system to the hidden system, follow these steps:\n1) Start the decoy system.\n2) Save the files to an unencrypted volume or to an outer/normal VeraCrypt volume.\n3) Start the hidden system.\n4) If you saved the files to a VeraCrypt volume, mount it (it will be automatically mounted as read-only).\n5) Copy the files to the hidden system partition or to another hidden volume.</entry>

    <entry lang="en" key="TRAVELER_LIMITATIONS_NOTE">Note about portable mode:\n\nPlease note that the operating system requires drivers to be registered with it before they can be started. Hence, the VeraCrypt driver is not (and cannot be) fully portable (whereas the VeraCrypt applications are fully portable, i.e. they do not have to be installed or registered with the operating system). Also note that VeraCrypt needs a driver to provide transparent on-the-fly encryption/decryption.</entry>

VeraCrypt needs a device driver to provide transparent on-the-fly encryption/decryption, and users without administrator privileges cannot start device drivers in Windows. Therefore, the system will ask you for permission to run VeraCrypt with administrator privileges (UAC prompt).\n\nNote that if you install VeraCrypt on the system (as opposed to running VeraCrypt in portable mode), the system will NOT ask you for permission to run VeraCrypt (UAC prompt) every time you attempt to run it.\n\nAre you sure you want to extract the files?</entry>

    <entry lang="en" key="RESCUE_DISK_HELP_PORTION_2">I. How to Boot VeraCrypt Rescue Disk\n\nTo boot a VeraCrypt Rescue Disk, insert it into your CD/DVD drive and restart your computer. If the VeraCrypt Rescue Disk screen does not appear (or if you do not see the 'Repair Options' item in the 'Keyboard Controls' section of the screen), it is possible that your BIOS is configured to attempt to boot from hard drives before CD/DVD drives. If that is the case, restart your computer, press F2 or Delete (as soon as you see a BIOS start-up screen), and wait until a BIOS configuration screen appears. If no BIOS configuration screen appears, restart (reset) the computer again and start pressing F2 or Delete repeatedly as soon as you restart (reset) the computer. When a BIOS configuration screen appears, configure your BIOS to boot from the CD/DVD drive first (for information on how to do so, please refer to the documentation for your BIOS/motherboard or contact your computer vendor's technical support team for assistance). Then restart your computer. The VeraCrypt Rescue Disk screen should appear now. Note: In the VeraCrypt Rescue Disk screen, you can select 'Repair Options' by pressing F8 on your keyboard.\n\n\n</entry>

    <entry lang="en" key="RESCUE_DISK_HELP_PORTION_4">1) If the VeraCrypt Boot Loader screen does not appear after you start your computer (or if Windows does not boot), the VeraCrypt Boot Loader may be damaged. The VeraCrypt Rescue Disk allows you to restore it and thus to regain access to your encrypted system and data (however, note that you will still have to enter the correct password then). In the Rescue Disk screen, select 'Repair Options' &gt; 'Restore VeraCrypt Boot Loader'. Then press 'Y' to confirm the action, remove the Rescue Disk from your CD/DVD drive and restart your computer.\n\n</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="RESCUE_DISK_HELP_PORTION_5">2) If you repeatedly enter the correct password but VeraCrypt says that the password is incorrect, the master key or other critical data may be damaged.

    <entry lang="en" key="RESCUE_DISK_HELP_PORTION_6">3) If the VeraCrypt Boot Loader is damaged, you can avoid running it by booting directly from the VeraCrypt Rescue Disk. Insert your Rescue Disk into your CD/DVD drive and then enter your password in the Rescue Disk screen.\n\n</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="RESCUE_DISK_HELP_PORTION_7">4) If Windows is damaged and cannot start, the VeraCrypt Rescue Disk allows you to permanently decrypt the partition/drive before Windows starts. In the Rescue Disk screen, select 'Repair Options' &gt; 'Permanently decrypt system partition/drive'. Enter the correct password and wait until decryption is complete. Then you can e.g. boot your MS Windows setup CD/DVD to repair your Windows installation.\n\n</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="RESCUE_DISK_HELP_PORTION_8">Note: Alternatively, if Windows is damaged (cannot start) and you need to repair it (or access files on it), you can avoid decrypting the system partition/drive by following these steps: If you have multiple operating systems installed on your computer, boot the one that does not require pre-boot authentication. If you do not have multiple operating systems installed on your computer, you can boot a WinPE or BartPE CD/DVD or you can connect your system drive as a secondary or external drive to another computer and then boot the operating system installed on the computer. After you boot a system, run VeraCrypt, click 'Select Device', select the affected system partition, click 'OK', select 'System' &gt; 'Mount Without Pre-Boot Authentication', enter your pre-boot authentication password and click 'OK'. The partition will be mounted as a regular VeraCrypt volume (data will be on-the-fly decrypted/encrypted in RAM on access, as usual).\n\n\n</entry>

    <entry lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_2">How to Create Decoy System Safely and Securely\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn order to achieve plausible deniability, you need to create the decoy operating system now. To do so, follow these steps:\n\n</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_3">1) For security reasons, shut down your computer and leave it powered off for at least several minutes (the longer, the better). This is required to clear the memory, which contains sensitive data. Then turn on the computer but do not boot the hidden system.\n\n</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_4">2) Install Windows on the partition whose content has been erased (i.e. on the partition where the original system, of which the hidden system is a clone, was installed).\n\nIMPORTANT: WHEN YOU START INSTALLING THE DECOY SYSTEM, THE HIDDEN SYSTEM WILL *NOT* BE POSSIBLE TO BOOT (because the VeraCrypt Boot Loader will be erased by the Windows system installer). THIS IS NORMAL AND EXPECTED. PLEASE DO NOT PANIC. YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BOOT THE HIDDEN SYSTEM AGAIN AS SOON AS YOU START ENCRYPTING THE DECOY SYSTEM (because VeraCrypt will then automatically install the VeraCrypt Boot Loader on the system drive).\n\nImportant: The size of the decoy system partition must remain the same as the size of the hidden volume (this condition is now met). Moreover, you must not create any partition between the decoy system partition and the partition where the hidden system resides.\n\n</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_5">3) Boot the decoy system (which you installed in step 2 and install VeraCrypt on it).\n\nKeep in mind that the decoy system must never contain any sensitive data.\n\n</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_6">4) On the decoy system, run VeraCrypt and select 'System' &gt; 'Encrypt System Partition/Drive'. The VeraCrypt Volume Creation Wizard window should appear.\n\nThe following steps apply to the VeraCrypt Volume Creation Wizard.\n\n</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_7">5) In the VeraCrypt Volume Creation Wizard, do NOT select the 'Hidden' option. Leave the 'Normal' option selected and click 'Next'.\n\n</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_8">6) Select the option 'Encrypt the Windows system partition' and then click 'Next'.\n\n</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_9">7) If there are only the hidden system and the decoy system installed on the computer, select the option 'Single-boot' (if there are more than these two systems installed on the computer, select 'Multi-boot'). Then click 'Next'.\n\n</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_10">8) IMPORTANT: In this step, FOR THE DECOY SYSTEM, YOU MUST SELECT THE SAME ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM AND HASH ALGORITHM THAT YOU SELECTED FOR THE HIDDEN SYSTEM! OTHERWISE, THE HIDDEN SYSTEM WILL BE INACCESSIBLE! In other words, the decoy system must be encrypted with the same encryption algorithm as the hidden system. Note: The reason is that the decoy system and the hidden system will share a single boot loader, which supports only a single algorithm, selected by the user (for each algorithm, there is a special version of the VeraCrypt Boot Loader).\n\n</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_11">9) In this step, choose a password for the decoy operating system. This will be the password that you will be able to reveal to an adversary if you are asked or forced to disclose your pre-boot authentication password (the other password you can reveal is the one for the outer volume). The existence of the third password (i.e. of the pre-boot authentication password for the hidden operating system) will remain secret.\n\nImportant: The password you choose for the decoy system must be substantially different from the one you chose for the hidden volume (i.e. for the hidden operating system).\n\n</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_12">10) Follow the remaining instructions in the wizard so as to encrypt the decoy operating system.\n\n\n\n</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_13">After Decoy System Is Created\n------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter you encrypt the decoy system, the whole process of creation of the hidden operating system will be completed and you will be able to use these three passwords:\n\n1) Pre-boot authentication password for the hidden operating system.\n\n2) Pre-boot authentication password for the decoy operating system.\n\n3) Password for the outer volume.\n\n</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_14">If you want to start the hidden operating system, you will just need to enter the password for the hidden operating system in the VeraCrypt Boot Loader screen (which appears after you turn on or restart your computer).\n\nIf you want to start the decoy operating system, you will just need to enter the password for the decoy operating system in the VeraCrypt Boot Loader screen.\n\nThe password for the decoy system can be disclosed to anyone forcing you to reveal your pre-boot authentication password. The existence of the hidden volume (and of the hidden operating system) will remain secret.\n\n</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_15">The third password (for the outer volume) can be disclosed to anyone forcing you to reveal the password for the first partition behind the system partition, where both the outer volume and the hidden volume (containing the hidden operating system) reside. The existence of the hidden volume (and of the hidden operating system) will remain secret.\n\n\n</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_16">If you revealed the password for the decoy system to an adversary and he asked you why the free space of the (decoy) system partition contains random data, you could answer, for example: "The partition previously contained a system encrypted by VeraCrypt, but I forgot the pre-boot authentication password (or the system was damaged and stopped booting), so I had to reinstall Windows and encrypt the partition again."\n\n\n</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_17">If all the instructions are followed and if the precautions and requirements listed in the section "Security Requirements and Precautions Pertaining to Hidden Volumes" in the VeraCrypt User's Guide are followed, it should be impossible to prove that the hidden volume and hidden operating system exist, even when the outer volume is mounted or when the decoy operating system is decrypted or started.\n\nIf you save a copy of this text or print it (strongly recommended, unless your printer stores copies of documents it prints on its internal drive), you should destroy any copies of it after you have created the decoy system and after you have understood all the information contained in the text (otherwise, if such a copy was found, it might indicate that there is a hidden operating system on this computer).\n\n</entry>
    <entry lang="en" key="DECOY_OS_INSTRUCTIONS_PORTION_18">WARNING: IF YOU DO NOT PROTECT THE HIDDEN VOLUME (for information on how to do so, refer to the section "Protection of Hidden Volumes Against Damage" in the VeraCrypt User's Guide), DO NOT WRITE TO THE OUTER VOLUME (note that the decoy operating system is NOT installed in the outer volume).
